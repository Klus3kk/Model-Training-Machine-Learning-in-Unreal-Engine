# Model-Training-Machine-Learning-in-Unreal-Engine
This project explores the integration of machine learning model training within the Unreal Engine environment. The aim is to leverage Unreal Engine's powerful simulation capabilities to generate training data, train machine learning models, and apply these models within the game engine. This approach can be used for a variety of applications, including intelligent NPC behavior, real-time strategy adaptation, and more.
